      "stem": "A 62-year-old man with both erectile dysfunction and moderate BPH symptoms (nocturia x3, weak stream) asks if there is a single medication that could help both conditions. He is not taking nitrates. Which medication is the best option?",
      "options": [
        "Sildenafil 50 mg as needed",
        "Tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily",
        "Tadalafil 5 mg daily",
        "Finasteride 5 mg daily"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Tadalafil (Cialis) 5 mg daily is FDA-approved for both erectile dysfunction AND BPH/LUTS. It is the only PDE-5 inhibitor with this dual indication. Dr. Sullivan specifically noted this as a board-tested point. Sildenafil treats ED but is not approved for BPH. Tamsulosin treats BPH but not ED. Finasteride treats BPH but can actually worsen ED as a side effect.",

      "options": [
        "No further follow-up needed since symptoms resolved",
        "Perform a test of cure with repeat NAAT testing in 1-2 weeks after treatment completion",
        "Repeat treatment with a second dose of ceftriaxone as a precaution",
        "Screen only his sexual partners and discharge the patient from care"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Gonorrhea requires a test of cure, meaning repeat testing after treatment to confirm eradication. This is due to increasing antibiotic resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Dr. Sullivan specifically emphasized this point: 'Gonorrhea requires a test of cure prior to releasing the patient from care.' Symptom resolution alone is insufficient. Chlamydia, by contrast, does not routinely require test of cure unless the patient is pregnant.",

      "options": [
        "Nocturia, as it indicates worsening BPH",
        "Weak stream, as it suggests possible urinary retention",
        "Hematuria, as it is a red flag that requires further workup to rule out malignancy",
        "Hesitancy, as it indicates possible neurogenic bladder"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Hematuria is a red flag for LUTS that requires urgent evaluation. While nocturia, weak stream, and hesitancy are common BPH symptoms, hematuria raises concern for bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma, or other serious pathology. Dr. Sullivan emphasized: 'Hematuria is THE red flag for LUTS.' Workup includes urinalysis, urine cytology, and referral for cystoscopy and upper tract imaging.",

        "Lipid panel",
        "Digital rectal exam"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Lipid screening is universally recommended for adult men as part of cardiovascular risk assessment. Dr. Sullivan noted: 'Most men's health questions are actually cardiovascular, endocrine, or cancer screening questions in disguise.' PSA screening requires shared decision-making and is not universal. Testicular ultrasound is not a routine screening tool. DRE is not recommended as a standalone screening.",

        "Adhesive capsulitis",
        "Cervical radiculopathy referring pain to the shoulder",
        "Shoulder impingement syndrome"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Cervical radiculopathy can masquerade as shoulder pain, which Dr. Sullivan specifically flagged as a high-yield board differential. Key clues: pain radiating from neck to arm, numbness/tingling in fingers, positive Spurling test (neck compression reproduces arm symptoms), and failure to improve with shoulder-specific therapy. The best initial imaging is cervical MRI (not shoulder MRI). Always consider the neck when shoulder treatment fails.",

        "Meniscal tear",
        "Septic arthritis",
        "Prepatellar bursitis",
        "ACL sprain"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Prepatellar bursitis presents with localized anterior knee swelling over the patella, often from repetitive kneeling (hence 'housemaid's knee' or 'carpet layer's knee'). Dr. Sullivan highlighted the differentiation of prepatellar bursitis vs. septic joint as a key board differential. Critical distinction: in bursitis, the swelling is superficial and anterior, the joint itself has normal ROM and is stable, and the patient is afebrile. In septic arthritis, the entire joint is hot, swollen, painful with any movement, and the patient typically has fever. Treatment for bursitis: rest, ice, NSAIDs, and avoiding kneeling.",

She denies trauma, locking, catching, or instability. On exam, there is no effusion and ligament testing is normal. Pain is reproduced with compression of the patella against the femoral groove. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) presents with anterior knee pain that worsens with activities that load the patellofemoral joint: climbing stairs, squatting, prolonged sitting ('theater sign'). Dr. Sullivan noted that 'pain climbing stairs is going to be patellofemoral.' No mechanical symptoms (locking/catching = meniscus) and no instability (giving way = ACL). Treatment is conservative: quadriceps strengthening (especially VMO), activity modification, and NSAIDs.",

      "stem": "A 28-year-old woman with known SLE presents with worsening joint pain, fatigue, and facial rash. Her provider orders labs to assess disease activity. Which lab finding is most consistent with an active lupus flare?",
      "options": [
        "Elevated C3 and C4 complement levels",
        "Decreased C3 and C4 complement levels with elevated anti-dsDNA",
        "Normal complement levels with negative ANA",
        "Elevated rheumatoid factor"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "In active SLE flares, complement levels (C3, C4, CH50) are DECREASED because complement is consumed by immune complex formation. Simultaneously, anti-dsDNA antibody titers typically rise during active disease. Dr. Thompson emphasized checking complement levels as part of the lupus workup: 'C3, C4, CH50 complement levels, those might be decreased.' This pattern (low complement + high anti-dsDNA) is a classic marker of lupus disease activity, particularly in lupus nephritis.",

      "options": [
        "Anti-CCP antibodies",
        "Anti-SSA/Ro antibodies",
        "Antiphospholipid antibodies",
        "Anti-Smith antibodies"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Antiphospholipid antibodies (including anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I) are present in approximately 50% of lupus patients, as Dr. Thompson noted. These antibodies cause a hypercoagulable state leading to recurrent thrombosis (DVT, PE, stroke) and pregnancy complications (recurrent miscarriages, preeclampsia). Anti-CCP is for RA. Anti-SSA/Ro is for Sjogren's. Anti-Smith is specific for lupus diagnosis but does not explain the thrombotic/obstetric picture.",

      "options": [
        "Erythema nodosum",
        "Livedo reticularis",
        "Palpable purpura",
        "Erythema migrans"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Livedo reticularis is a mottled, net-like purplish discoloration of the skin, often seen on the lower extremities. Dr. Thompson described it in her lupus case study as 'basically just mottled skin to her lower extremities.' It is associated with SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome, reflecting underlying vascular inflammation or microthrombosis. Erythema nodosum is painful red nodules on the shins (sarcoidosis, IBD). Palpable purpura suggests small vessel vasculitis. Erythema migrans is the bull's-eye rash of Lyme disease.",

      "stem": "A 35-year-old woman presents with widespread body pain for 4 months, fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, and difficulty concentrating. Her CBC, BMP, TSH, ANA, ESR, RF, anti-CCP, and creatinine kinase are all normal. According to the ACR diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, which combination of findings supports this diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Positive ANA and elevated ESR with joint swelling",
        "Widespread Pain Index (WPI) greater than 7 AND Symptom Severity (SS) scale score greater than 5, with symptoms present for at least 3 months",
        "Elevated creatinine kinase with proximal muscle weakness",
        "Morning stiffness greater than 60 minutes with symmetric joint erosions on X-ray"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The ACR criteria for fibromyalgia require: (1) Widespread Pain Index (WPI) > 7 AND Symptom Severity Scale (SS) > 5, (2) symptoms present for at least 3 months, and (3) no other disorder that would explain the pain. Dr. Thompson walked through these criteria in her fibromyalgia case study: 'Symptoms have been present for at least 3 months, does not have any other disorder that would explain the pain, and widespread pain index greater than 7, and symptom severity scale score greater than 5.' All labs are characteristically normal in fibromyalgia — this is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion.",

      "explanation": "Doxycycline 100 mg BID for 7 days is the preferred first-line treatment for uncomplicated chlamydial urethritis (CDC 2021 guidelines updated preference from azithromycin to doxycycline due to better efficacy). Azithromycin 1g single dose is an acceptable alternative. Dr. Sullivan reviewed this: a 22-year-old with dysuria and discharge most likely has chlamydia, treated with azithromycin or doxycycline. Ceftriaxone is for gonorrhea. Metronidazole is for trichomonas or BV. Ciprofloxacin is no longer recommended for gonorrhea due to resistance.",
