      "stem": "A 58-year-old African American man presents for his annual wellness exam. He has no urinary complaints and his digital rectal exam is normal. He asks about prostate cancer screening. His father was diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 62. What is the most appropriate next step?",
      "options": [
        "Order a PSA level immediately given his high-risk status",
        "Engage in shared decision-making about the benefits and harms of PSA screening",
        "Reassure him that PSA screening is no longer recommended for any age group",
        "Defer screening until age 70 when prostate cancer risk peaks"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The USPSTF recommends shared decision-making for PSA screening in men aged 55-69 (Grade C recommendation). While this patient has two high-risk factors (African American race and positive family history), the process still requires informed consent through shared decision-making. Option A is incorrect because even in high-risk patients, screening should not be ordered without discussing risks and benefits first. Option C is incorrect because the USPSTF does not recommend against screening for men 55-69. Option D is incorrect because the USPSTF recommends against routine screening in men 70 and older.",

He has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia and his DRE reveals a symmetrically enlarged, smooth, non-tender prostate. What is the most appropriate next step?",
      "options": [
        "Refer immediately to urology for prostate biopsy",
        "Repeat the PSA level in 4-6 weeks with abstinence from ejaculation for 48 hours prior",
        "Start finasteride to reduce the PSA level",
        "Order a CT scan of the pelvis to evaluate for prostate malignancy"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "PSA can be elevated by several benign conditions including BPH, prostatitis, recent ejaculation, vigorous exercise, and urinary tract instrumentation. This patient has known BPH and ejaculated the night before the blood draw, both of which can falsely elevate PSA. The appropriate step is to repeat the PSA after eliminating confounders. Option A is incorrect because a single elevated PSA in the setting of known confounders does not warrant immediate biopsy. Option C would mask a potentially meaningful result. Option D is incorrect because CT is not the imaging modality of choice for prostate evaluation.",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The USPSTF gives a Grade D recommendation against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men aged 70 and older, meaning there is moderate or high certainty that the harms outweigh the benefits. Option A is incorrect because even with a life expectancy greater than 10 years, the USPSTF recommendation against screening in this age group stands. Option C is incorrect because DRE alone is not recommended as a screening tool. Option D is incorrect because the fundamental issue is that routine screening is not recommended at this age.",

      "explanation": "Erectile dysfunction can be an early marker of systemic vascular disease and may precede clinical coronary artery disease (CAD) by 2-5 years. This patient has multiple cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, pre-diabetes, hypertension). Option A is incorrect because prescribing a PDE-5 inhibitor without first evaluating for cardiovascular disease would miss a critical opportunity. Option C is incorrect because penile Doppler is a specialized test not part of initial primary care workup.

      "explanation": "PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) are absolutely contraindicated in patients taking any form of nitrates. The combination can cause severe, potentially fatal hypotension. Alternative options such as vacuum erection devices or urology referral should be explored. Option A and B are incorrect because both are PDE-5 inhibitors contraindicated with nitrates. Option D is incorrect because discontinuing a cardiac medication to enable ED treatment is outside the FNP scope and would require cardiology consultation.",

      "explanation": "The initial laboratory workup for ED should identify common underlying causes including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypogonadism. This includes lipid panel, fasting glucose/HbA1c, morning total testosterone, CBC and CMP. Option B is incorrect because free PSA is a prostate cancer screening tool not part of ED workup.

        "Start testosterone replacement therapy based on the low result and his symptoms",

        "Order a free testosterone level drawn at the same afternoon time for consistency",
        "Refer to endocrinology for pituitary MRI"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Testosterone levels follow a diurnal pattern, with the highest levels in the early morning (8-10 AM). A single low result drawn in the afternoon is insufficient for diagnosis. Confirmation with a repeat morning total testosterone on a separate day is required. Option A is incorrect because initiating TRT based on a single afternoon level would be premature. Option C is incorrect because the critical error to correct is the timing. Option D is incorrect because a pituitary MRI is only indicated after confirming hypogonadism with proper testing.",

      "options": [
        "Continue TRT unchanged since both values are within acceptable limits",
        "Discontinue TRT immediately and refer to hematology for the elevated hematocrit",
        "Address the polycythemia by considering dose reduction or temporary hold, and evaluate the PSA rise further",
        "Switch to a topical testosterone gel, as this formulation does not affect hematocrit"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "TRT monitoring requires regular assessment of both hematocrit and PSA. TRT stimulates erythropoiesis and can cause polycythemia (hematocrit >54% is a threshold for concern). This patient's hematocrit of 54% warrants dose reduction, temporary hold, or therapeutic phlebotomy. The PSA rise also needs evaluation. Option A is incorrect because a hematocrit of 54% is at the threshold requiring intervention. Option B is overly aggressive; dose adjustment is first-line. Option D is incorrect because all forms of TRT can increase hematocrit.",

      "explanation": "Testosterone gel carries a significant risk of secondary transference through skin-to-skin contact. Women and children are particularly vulnerable \u00e2\u20ac\u201d children can develop precocious puberty, women can develop virilization. The patient must cover the site with clothing, wash hands after application. Option A is incorrect because scrotal application is not recommended for standard gel. Option C is incorrect because morning application mimics physiologic diurnal patterns. Option D is excessive; covering the site and handwashing are sufficient.",

      "explanation": "Alpha-1 adrenergic blockers such as tamsulosin are first-line for BPH with mild-to-moderate symptoms, relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck. Option A (finasteride) is more appropriate for moderate-to-severe BPH with significantly enlarged prostates and takes 6+ months. Option C (oxybutynin) is for overactive bladder and could worsen retention in BPH. Option D is for bacterial prostatitis, not BPH.",

      "explanation": "After an anaphylactic reaction, formal allergy testing should be performed through an allergist referral in the outpatient setting. The allergist can perform comprehensive testing, develop an allergy action plan, and assess for cross-reactivities. An EpiPen must always be prescribed. Option A is wrong because skin prick testing after a recent anaphylactic event should be done by an allergist with appropriate monitoring and resuscitation equipment. Option B is wrong because formal testing can identify additional allergens, cross-reactive foods, and severity, which guides long-term management. Option C is wrong because a total serum IgE level is nonspecific and does not confirm specific allergens.",

When a patient with risk factors for HIV presents with a mono-like illness and a negative monospot, HIV testing is essential. A 4th generation HIV Ag/Ab test or HIV RNA viral load can detect acute infection.

The raised, non-blanching lesions result from inflammation and damage to small blood vessels in the skin, allowing red blood cells to extravasate into surrounding tissue. Option A is wrong because large vessel vasculitis (GCA, Takayasu) affects the aorta and its major branches and does not typically produce palpable purpura.

Genetic testing for dystrophin gene mutations confirms the diagnosis. Option A is wrong because JIA presents with joint inflammation, not progressive muscle weakness with elevated CK.
